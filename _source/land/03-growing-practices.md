title: Growing Practices
---
Dirtfolk Farm utilizes regenerative agroecological practices to preserve the health of the soil, water, and products we produce. These practices include: 
- reduced tillage
- zero synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use
- crop rotation
- mulching and cover cropping
- use of safe compost materials & 1-ingredient amendments
- and integrated pest management 

These practices help us preserve water, sequester carbon, grow healthy, resilient plants, and preserve soil structure. Although we utilize "organic" practices, we do not pay to recieve the USDA Organic label at this time.
