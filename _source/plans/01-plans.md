Dirtfolk Farm is in our first year of production! 2025 is a year of building - community, infrastructure, and operations. We have big goals for the next 5 years.

Being a first generation farm and acutely aware of "not knowing what we don't know", we want to make sure our foundation is solid, our plans are thoughtful,  supported, and sustainable. Here are a list of future goals and plans over the next few years:

# 2025
