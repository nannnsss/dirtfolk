title: Who is Dirtfolk
---

Dirtfolk is the lifelong realized dream of a wannabe farmer, nature lover, and food access advocate named Anna. She first grew food as a child, in a small, suburban, backyard garden in Southern Oregon - and it felt like magic. She has been chasing the opportunity to grow food since that moment, from small containers on an apartment balcony or large gardens that fed her family and friends. When the opportunity arose to scale up and do something big - she jumped in.

Dirtfolk Farm is managed and operated by Anna and is supported by volunteers on a work-share agreement.
